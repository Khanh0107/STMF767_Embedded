# Task

## 1. Introduction

- A task is a unit of execution (a piece of code or function) that performs a specific job.
- Only 1 task executes at a time, because a single core can fetch, decode, and execute only one instruction stream at once.

## 2. Task States

- 1. Running 
  - The task is currently being executed on the CPU.
  - Only one task per core can be in this state at any moment.
- 2. Ready 
  - The task is ready to run (has all resources) but the CPU is busy with another task.
  - Tasks in this state are waiting for the scheduler to give them CPU time.
  - If a higher priority task becomes ready, it can preempt (take over) the running task.
- 3. Blocked 
  - The task is waiting for something to happen before it can continue:
  - Example: waiting for a delay (vTaskDelay()), waiting for a queue, semaphore, or event.
  - Once the resource/event becomes available â†’ the task goes back to Ready state.
- 4. Suspended 
  - The task is manually suspended by calling vTaskSuspend().
  - It will not run until explicitly resumed with vTaskResume().
  - Difference from Blocked:
    - Blocked: waiting automatically for a resource/event.
    - Suspended: paused manually by the programmer.

## 3. Scheduling

- Each task is assigned a priority level. The RTOS always selects the highest priority task that is ready to run.
- If a new task with a higher priority becomes ready while a lower priority task is running, the RTOS will pause (preempt) the running task and switch execution to the higher priority task.
- The RTOS uses a priority queue for tasks that are ready to run. Whenever the scheduler makes a decision, it picks the task with the highest priority from the ready queue and executes it
