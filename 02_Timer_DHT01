# 1. Timer

- Timer is a hardware peripheral inside the microcontroller (MCU) used to measure time or count events based on a clock signal. 
- Timers are essential because many embedded applications require precise timing without overloading the CPU.

- A typical MCU timer includes:
  - Counter register (CNT): Holds the current count value.
  - Prescaler (PSC): Divides the input clock to slow down counting.
  - Auto-reload register (ARR): Defines the maximum value before the counter resets.
