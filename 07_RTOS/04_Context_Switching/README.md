# Context Switching 

## 1. What is context switching

- In an RTOS, context switching is the process of saving the current taskâ€™s CPU context (registers, stack pointer, program counter, etc.) and restoring another taskâ€™s context so that the CPU can continue running the new task as if it had never been interrupted.
- This allows multiple tasks to share a single processor while still meeting real-time constraints.

### 1.1 PendSV (Pending Supervisor Call)

- A special exception available on ARM Cortex-M cores.
- Specifically designed to handle context switching in RTOS.
  
ðŸ‘‰ PendSV = a software interrupt dedicated for task switching.

### 1.2. SysTick

- A hardware timer built into Cortex-M.
- In FreeRTOS, configured to generate periodic interrupts (e.g., every 1ms).
- On every SysTick interrupt:
  - FreeRTOS increments the tick count.
  - Checks whether any tasks with delay/timeout are ready to run.
  - If yes â†’ request a context switch by triggering PendSV.

ðŸ‘‰ SysTick = the clock/alarm that tells the RTOS when to switch.
ðŸ‘‰ PendSV = the worker that actually performs the switch.

### 1.3. vTaskSwitchContext()

- A core function in the FreeRTOS scheduler.
- It doesnâ€™t switch tasks directly. Instead, it:
  - Scans the ready list.
  - Picks the highest-priority task that should run.
  - Updates pxCurrentTCB to point to the new taskâ€™s TCB.

ðŸ‘‰ The real register/stack switch is still done inside PendSV.

### 1.4. pxCurrentTCB

- A global pointer inside FreeRTOS.
- Always points to the Task Control Block (TCB) of the currently running task.

**CPU running Task 1**

- Task 1 code at address 0xAF200
  - Local vars: a, b, c, d in STACK1 (e.g., a at 0xAC800).
- CPU registers:
  - PC = 0xAF20C â†’ CPU is currently executing inside Task 1.
  - SP = 0xAC800 â†’ points to Task 1â€™s stack frame.
- TCB1:
  - Holds Task 1â€™s state (PC=0xAF20C, SP=0xAC800, plus R0â€“R12).
- TCB2: not active yet, just waiting with initial values.

ðŸ‘‰ CPU is executing Task 1. Task 2 is inactive.
