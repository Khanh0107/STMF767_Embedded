# 1. Overview 

- Controlling a 16x2 character LCD (based on the popular HD44780 controller) using the STM32F767 microcontroller through GPIO pins is a fundamental project in embedded systems development.
- This setup allows displaying text, numbers, and basic symbols on the LCD without the need for additional communication modules like IÂ²C or SPI.
